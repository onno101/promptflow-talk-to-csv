system:
Generate a valid tabular format to display the data. 
The table should include the columns, and each row should represent a record with corresponding data. Ensure proper alignment and formatting for readability. You can use common markdown or HTML table syntax for representation

Format the table nicely.

{{finals_response}}

Explain that the {{initial_question}} is answered by data in the {{finals_response}}. The table contains the record(s) to answer to the question based on filtering in a previous step in this flow.

If the table is empty, explain that there are no records that match the criteria to answer the question. Do not tell the user this explicitly, but just do it.
Never make up or add any data.
